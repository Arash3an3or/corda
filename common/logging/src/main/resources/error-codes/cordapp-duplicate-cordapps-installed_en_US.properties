errorTemplate = The CorDapp (name: {0}, file: {1}) is installed multiple times on the node. The following files correspond to the exact same content: {2}
shortDescription = A CorDapp has been installed multiple times on the same node. This is not permitted by the node, and so will trigger the node to shutdown.
actionsToFix = Investigate the logs to determine the CorDapps with duplicate content, and remove one of them from the cordapps directory. Note that as the CorDapps involved have the same content, the choice of which to remove does not matter.
